# Dan's React Stack

A lightweight template containing everything I typically use in my React projects, including:

- React (TypeScript)
- Vite
- Tailwind (v4)

## Setup

First, degit the repository:

```bash
npx degit https://github.com/dancreightondev/dans-react-stack project-name
```

Secondly, install the node modules:

```bash
npm i
```

Lastly, run the project using **one** of:

```bash
npm run dev
```

```bash
npm run localhost
```

```bash
npm run network
```
